# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I created this site to learn and practice the basics of coding and GITHUB. It enabled me to learn the foundations of what I hope to be a expansive career. 

By following the tutorial set out by the Skills For Life bootcamp, I used:

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Visual Studio Code
-Github
-Git Bash  

I now appreciate why coding is considered a language, and I can see how it will get easier over time.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
